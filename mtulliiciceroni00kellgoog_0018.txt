Cicero's politienl hopes were not quite abandoned. Some
younger naen, thoroughly equipped for politia-l lise, might yet
hring back the glory of the republic. For public lise orator-y
was a most important preparation. It πω this which had given
him his own civie honois. He would keep alive this power of
speech, for the sake of the State he loved so well. He would,
is possible, train up a genenfion of noble oraton, ιο be a bul-
wnrk agminst the encroachrnenss os persona] power.

2. There were special motives to the composition os the
Brutus, such as me following: (r) to trane the development
of Cicero's favor-ite arn (2) to show the place os oratory iix
public lise; (3) aud the equiprnene needed by the orator
(the shortcomings of the men he named would be sn admoni-
tion) ; (⁴) to do justice to the earlier Roman oratore, who
were now undervalued5 (5) to stimulate hy example 3 (6) to
furnish incentivas ω pau-ioth: feeling <Greek orator-s must be
briefly notieed, but the list would be chiefly Roman,--long
enough and illustrioris enough to stir the pulses os all good
Romans) ; (7) to gain a vaninge-ground for the handling of
certain pmctiml questions, eg. the differeuce between the
Asian and the Attio styles os oratory3 (8) to answer eritieisms
directed against Cicero himself. Among his critics was the
very man he addreeeed (see Quint. XII. ι, n, and Tac. Παλ
18; and cil Quint XII. ιο. 12). Os these criticisms he2was>⁴
quite avare (cs. Or. ¹³· 4o; 7¹. ²37)- To the public Δι’
large he would also make answer- He had an eager desire ro
stand well with his countrymen. He believed in his style os
oratory 3 he wished others ω believe in it also.

The immediate impelling motive to this treatise was [umished
by a histor-imi work os Atticusss the Liber Annalis: which iri its
turn was said by its author to be due to Cicero's de Republica,

η written nc. 54 (eL de Dio. ΙΙ, r. 3). Varro’s historica] writings

(cs. ¹5· ⁶03 56. ²⁰5) had prepared Cicero sor this new impulse
srorn Atticus.
