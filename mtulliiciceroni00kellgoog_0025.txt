great Roman orator⁴ Certain failings in his conduct are only
mo apparent. He was free to spen-k his own pruises3 but is we
πλη the acts of other distinguished Romans, eg. Cato, and
Scipio, and Pompey, we shall agree with Professor Goeenough,
that ‘ modesty, real or assumed, is a late growth of eivilization!
Cicero was irresolute in some important crises. 'But he shewed
undaunted courage in his speech sor Roscius, in his suppression
of the Catilinam-n conspiracy, in his fruitless opposition to An«
tonyi The title of pater patriae befitted him as a true Roman
and pauiot. In adven-sity he made pitisul complaints; but
these were private outbuxsts of feeling, not to be judged as
public or deliberate utteranees. Other men could lament, and
none save sympathizing friends would know it: Cicero's max-
vellous ehann of style has robbed his life of its just privacy. He
was a man os unimpeached integrity and purity of character.
His ideal osan orator demanded high airus and eminent virtues.

Cicero's range os studies and aequisitions gave him broad
and just views. He was omnivnrous in his studies; not ,in a
superficial or hap-hanni way, but as an easnest student, and
always with special reference to his function as an orator.
Beyond cavil he was a finished literary artist. No style ever
wrought so great a change as that os Cicero. Before him latin
prose was ruore or less awkward and eumbrous3 in him it
sprang nt once to perfectiori. A style which holds ivs own,
century aster century, implies a cultivated power of thought
that betokens the best qualifications for crifieism.' As a sympa-
thetic advocate, he might exaggerate the merits os a elient's
case; but iu such cn'ticism as the Brutus contains there was
little temptation to exaggerate. He was one of the oratois'
own eran, glorying in their m, and understanding their rea-l

suength.
