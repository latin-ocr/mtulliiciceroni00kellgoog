The Masmscripts os the Brutus derive from a single copy,
found at Ludi, in 1422, by Bishop Gherardo Landsiani. The
copy included the other chief rhetorical work! os Cicero, and
was of essential service in filling out the text os dc Oratore.
This copy was sent to Milan, to Gaspm-ino Earziza, and was
tui-ned over [or transcription to several hands; Brutus, to
Blondus Flavius os Milan. The origiml codex Laudemis was
neglected and lost. Copies were rapidly multiplied ς and from
the circumstances of the case the various extant Mss. differ
less than is usual iu classim-l texts. ’[Ἰιε original was not in
perfect condition ς as is shown by the imperfect ending, and
in a sew other places, where one or more words have [allen out.
The Mss. of the Brutus collated by Lagoumsini (for his
labors, cs- Wilkins’s de Or. p. 61) are of differ-ing velue: two
of them, with one Venefian and one Vaticau Ms.. are put by
Ellendt iu the first rank, as os nearly equal excellence md
authority: cf. Stangl, xuuod„ and Heerdegen, Jahrb. 1885,
pp* 105—112. For an account os other Mss.‚ see ElL haef.

The Edin'o princepx (Pid. Einl. p. 32) dates at Rome, 1⁴⁶⁵-
67. Among the best modern editions are those of Ellendt,
Meyer ἃς Bernhardy, Peter, Orelli ὅ( Baiter, Ο. Jahn (re-
vised by Eberherd), Baiter δι Kayser, Piderit, and Stangl.
These editions have been enriched and supplemented by the
criticisms os Lambinus, Ernesti, Schutz, Bake, and others.
The labore ns all these seholam, based on an original of no
inferior merit, have brought the text of the Brutus to an
unusually satisfactory condition.
