sive periods of their prominence, he was the friend of ΟΜ
and Pompey, os Brutus and Cassiusy os Antony and Octavian.
But his most intimate friend was Cicero ,- a ffiendship attested
by the very {rank lettels written to him by Cicero, so many os
which have come down to us. They cover a period of nearly
twenty-five years. The two men had been fellow-studenm in
youth (Nep. Att. 1). In a letter to Memmius (adFamixm. ι,
5) Cicero says, Pomponium Atticum sie amo u! alterum sm-
nm,- nihi! est illo milti net carius nec iucundius , . . est enim
omni liberali daetrina politissimus. Cicero could appeal to
him sor critical judgmenu: cs. ad Att. 1. ¹4- 3, meis arationi-

pmises os Caesar. (Cf. Pid. Eink p. ²8.)

Atticus was also nn intimate friend of Brutus (see Nep. Au.

adopted by his uncle, Q. Servilius Caepio, aud for this reason,
he is sometimes called Q. Caepio Brutus. His education was
