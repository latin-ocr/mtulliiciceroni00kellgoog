PREFACE.

—m—

‘Emeum is history teanhing by examples? In Cicero's
account οἱ Roman eloquence the mles of oratory are seen
applied mid exemplified. Living persons stand before us in
place os abstract principles⁴ This piece οί biography is a
special litei-ary history, not fully brought out in the general
surveys os Roman literature. Α competent critic speaks of
the work as invalmble, a mine οἱ insonantium one whose
delightt'ul peges give more stimulus ω an aspiring orator
than all the formal treatises os a later century.¹

This edition οἱ the Brutus is intended for early college read-
ing. The introduction tonches points os interest for those ιο
whom Cicero is no strnuger, and includes a tolerably full con-
spectus. The notes are illustrative os the text in its historical
relations and its diction, rather mah in the eommonplaoes os
grammar. English renderings are sparingly suggested, the
chief assistance being found in pasauel passages* These pns-
sages are largely from Cicero's other rhetorical works, and from
Quintilian. For the convenience of iustu-etms and interested
smdenos, references are added to passages not quoted. Aid
has been §ought from a variety of sources 3 bnt especial credit
is due to the editions of Ellendt, O. Jahn, and Piderit.
