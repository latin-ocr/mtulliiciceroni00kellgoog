INTRODUCHON. xiii

Tine diziogue form gives opportunity sor manisold views os
the subject, sor bringing out salient points, for introducing per-
sona! expet-ienae, sor strokes os miticism, for digressions md
apologia. Cicero is avare, for example, that he injures the
artistic effect os this neatise by calling up so nimy names:
Atticus complains os this, md Cicero makes his excuse.

ι. The tide is taken from one os the interlocutors, the one,
as it happens, whose pm is least prominent. Atticus was
older than Brutus, and has a larger share in the dialogue. But

been ΡΙεθοέ, but to have been appended by the Alexandrian
critias. Varro's Logiston'ci fumished a neaser precedent, with
