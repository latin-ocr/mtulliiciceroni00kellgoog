υ. 3, where Cicero eouples Brutus with Pompey, and says os
him, prinnpis iam pridem iuventutis, cehn‘ter, ut spero, civi-
tatis (ad Fam. XV. ¹4· 65 Or. xo. 34). But the days were dark
indeed when Cicero's best relianoe was upon this uncertain

the right preparation. He was himself an orator, consciously

the extant speeches os the men he (alls up from the past (ct,
