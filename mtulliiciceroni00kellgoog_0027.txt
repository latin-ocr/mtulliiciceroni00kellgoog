mc. 81). Richer sonus os oratory were developed under the
touch os Hom-mnus (cf. 88. 302). Latin masten os eloquenoe
had begua to win attention: the first os these was Plotius
Gallus, who began to teaeh about the time of the death of
Cusus. These latin rhetores, like the Greeks os nn earlier
time, were held at first in disiavor (cs. Merivale's Abeken,
p. 5: Eu. Bm. Hist. pp. 57, 97). Gnipho, a Roman with a
Greek education, instructed both Caesar and Cicero: but to
the end os the republic, oratory was deemed so much a foreign
prodiret that Romans tenacious os ancient ways thought it, as
Ellendt says, base to teaeh what it was honorahle to leam.

The larger development of oratory in this nge was due, not
only to a wider range of knowledge and thought, but also to
the character of the times. They were times os sanction, which
osten hroke into violence. Sulla¹s shadow, before passing away,
fell upon Cicero aswell as upon Caesar. Cicero's consulship
eneountered the Catilinas-ian conspiracy. His bznishment was
the work os the brutal Clodius. His Philippies were, like those
os Demosthenes, the last but magnificent fian-ne os the smte’s
expin'ng liberty. Such an nge called forth all the powers of
men who would control and guide the turbulent people.

In this advaneed period os Roman orator-y we find differing ⁴

tendencies in marked contrast. Three men maybe taken as
illustrative of the period; Cremo, his elder contemporary Hon-
Tmsms, and the man os universal geniusy Cmsmt⁴ They had
three different styles of orator-y. Os Caesar's orations none are
ext-ann but we rnay know stom his own writings, as well as
from Romu crificism, something os their character: they must
have been at once simple and elegant in language, concise,
closely and clearly logical, weighty, and effective from a certain
personal authority. They might be compnred with those of
the sirnpler and severer Atn'e oratore.

Hortensiuswas at an opposite extreme from the simplicity
os Cessas. From ure. 95 (see Jebb, Att. Or. 11. 447) he was
the Latin representative os Asianism⁴ Asianism isy os course,
