the old Attio standard was as wide-spread as che Hellenic race-
It made more rapi-‘l progress away from Atheus; in Alexandria,
in Sicily, in Asia Minor. Caecilius wrote against Phrygians
much ns Matthew Amold writes against Philistines (cf. Cic.
Or. 8. ²5)· In the Brutus (¹3· 51) Cieem seems ιο set the
Rhodia-ns apa-rt in m intermediam school between the Asian
and the Amic, yet pronomeing them Atticorum similiores (es.
Quint. xn. 10. 18—9). Cicero had pasena] reasons for com-
plimenting the Rhodjan school, as his savorite master Molo
taught there (cf. 9¹· 31⁶; and Sandys's Orator, Iun-od. p.
xxxvii). But critias like Jebb (Ate. Or. 11. 445-6) disanow the

became more Attin, like the Rhodius (cf. Jahn, Einl. p. 8).
But juvenile ‘superfluities' and ‘redundancies' (91. ³1⁶) do
not mean Asia-n corruption os style. We can easily apply Pro-
sessorJebb's test- He says (An. Or.ll.439) z ‘Asiauism versus
Atticism means the New versus the Old Orator-y. The essentia]
difference between them is this: the Old Oratory was an art,
aad was therefore based upon a theory, The New Oratory was
a knsck, and was founded upon practice. Atticism wu tech-

on a theory? In his youth (cs. Introd. Ι.) he composed an
elaborate treatise on rhetoric: hy the best os (ests he was not
