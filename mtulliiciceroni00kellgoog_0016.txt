Cioem's Brutus holds a definite md unique place among his
rhetorical writings. These wrin'ngs are, de Inventione, de Ora-
tore, Brutus, Orator, de optimo Genere Orator-um, de Partitiane
Orator-ia, Topica

Of these treatises de Inventione was a youthsul productioni
written, as Weidner thinks, mc. 84-83. Cicero himself depre-
eiated it at a latet day <de Or. 1. a. 5) us quae pueris au! atlu-
lescmlulis nobis ex commentariolis nostris incohata ac mdia
extidetum‘. The last duee “emises in the above list ase of
minor importanee5 de optimo Genera aratorum being merely a
preswe to Cicero's lost translation of the two great speeches iu
the ease of Ctesiphom de Par-titione Orawria, a catechetiml
outline drawn up sor the young Marcus Cicero ς Topica, a
sumnury (written on shipdxuxd, from xeeollection) based on
the Topies of Aristone. The three remaining works som a
series, giving us a complete acoeunt of the theory and practice
of omtory among the Romans to the middle os the last century
nc. De Oratore, completed Rc. 5 5, is the earliest, the most
elaborate, md the most important of (hese treatises. The Bru-
tus eomes next in order, but afletan interval os more than eight
yem. Herein the principles laid down in the fori-ner work sind

following year, furnishes an ideal mindam. (Cf. Hamecker,

ondly, a story os oratorieal attainmenrs 5 and thirdly, an ideal
of omtorical perseetion.
