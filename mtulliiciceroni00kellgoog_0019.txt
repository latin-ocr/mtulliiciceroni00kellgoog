The composition of the Brutus is assigned to the easly
months os the year 4⁶ mc. Caesar had brought the Alexan-
drine war to n close, defeated Pharnaces in Pontus, returned
to Rome and secured a third dictatorship, md departed for
Africa to crush Scipio and Cato. Au this was in the year
47 B-c. The decisive battle in Africa, at Thapsus, was fought
April σὼ, nc. 46, and the two Pompeizn leaders speedily took
their own lives. These eveum had not yet been reported at
Rome: see, ιζ, 31. 118 and 58. 212, where Cato and Scipio
are spoken οἱ as still living. In various places Cicero shows n
remaining gleam ol hope for the success of the Pompeians, and
ventures on moumful reflections and open regrets, and even
persona! allusions, as he would hardly have done later in that
year. For the illusive rumors that kept his hopes alive, cll, εὖ,
ad Att. XII. 2. ι, written in April. For invidious allusions to
Caesar himself, see 6. ²4 and 81. 281, and what is supposed to
have been a hint to Brutus, ¹4· 53, to ernulate the Brutus os

1. Plato's dialogues might well ten-apt Cicero to cast his
treatises in a like mould. Most of his philosophica-1 aud rhetori-
cal works are nominally dialogues But he found it hard to
keep them from running into monologues. And so the Aristo-
telian dialogues furnished Cicero a more acceptable model.
In describing his tseatise de Oratore he says, (ad Au. XIII* 19.

, 4) quae autem his temporibus κωφή, ’Apta-mm marm
habaent, in quo sermo ita inducitur cea-mrum, ut penes ᾔτηη sit

ἱ principatus: (cs. Waesorus Sekct [κίτταν os Cicero, p. ³14).
Theophrastus, whom (de Dio. 11. ι, 4) he classes wilh Aristotle
as a model, had imitated this style of dialogue. In the Brutus
there is more interchange os thought than is usual in Cieero’s
dialogues, with a corresponding gain ln vivaeity.
